## Welcome to Numgy!

Hello, my name is Benie Gouli and this is my very first "serious" Python project. 
I am using it to learn how to use git and github, revise what I have learned so far in python,
and learn how to make GUIs in python (I love GUIs)

Numgy is a simple Python game where the player has to guess a number between 1 and 100.  
This project uses `customtkinter` (tkinter is so outdated) to create a basic graphical user interface.

## Features
- Random number generation
- GUI with input box and feedback labels
- Retry and reset functionality
