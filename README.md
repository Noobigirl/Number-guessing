## Welcome to Numgy! ðŸŽ²

Hi, I'm Benie Gouliâ€”and this is my very first "serious" Python project!
I'm using it to practice Git and GitHub, review core Python concepts, and dive into GUI development (I love GUIs!).

**Numgy** is a simple number guessing game built with Python. The player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100.  
It uses `customtkinter` to build a clean, modern interface (because, letâ€™s be honestâ€”`tkinter` is kinda outdated ðŸ˜„).


## ðŸ”§ Features
- Random number generation
- User-friendly GUI with input fields and feedback labels
- Retry and reset functionality
- trials left and score

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

Here's what Numgy looks like for now:

## What I have learned
- I actually understood what is super(): It means go to the next class in MRO if method/ attribute not found in the current class
- I learned how to position text with the anchor and justify attributes
- I learned how to use StringVar and textVariable
- I learned how to get the content of an entry with .get() and how to delete it with .delete()
